I wanted a career change and so I have begun my studies to obtain a bachelor's in information technology. I fly FPV drones and use that skill for photography and cinematography. My Instagram is turd_fpv. My interests in IT are new technologies in the industry, networking and security, and to learn as much as I can about programming languages, how things work, how and why things do what they do. Our team’s name is KABBAM. I wish to pursue a career in cyber security and am using this undergraduate qualification to assist me in getting into my first role in IT where I can gain experience and continue studying to reach my ideal job as an ethical hacker or security analyst.  </p>

                        <p align="left">As a group we were glad to capture a HD for our efforts in assignment 2. Marching forward, the common consensus among us all is that we needed to develop a stronger attitude towards being disciplined with setting deadlines for individual tasks, so that we would avoid being ambushed in the final days leading up to the due date. As a solution we’ve decided to incorporate Trello, a digital pin board to assist with organizing individual tasks.  
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, we decided to hold some of our group video calls without all members present. We found that even if we picked a date when all team members were available, this could easily change due to work commitments and other life events. To avoid constant rescheduling, we decided to lock in dates for meetings and if anyone was not present we would be able to fill them in afterwards based on the meeting minutes. </p>

                            <strong>Marcus Kelly</strong>
                            <br> Based on feedback and my own personal reflection after completing assignment 2, I have not had any real change of heart towards my goal of becoming a front-end developer. The main commonalities between my own goal and my peer's goals are essentially that they’re all IT based. While the skill sets and experience requirements may be slightly varied between the group, I believe we would all benefit from staying in contact with each other and maintaining an interest in each other's fields, as there is enough of a basic overlap that any knowledge we can share between each other will probably be beneficial for our own careers. 
                            <br><br>
                            Another main takeaway from the ongoing discussions I have had with my group members is that whilst all other members require quite an extensive work history or educational background, I could potentially become a successful front-end developer based mostly on my portfolio. This means I could potentially begin to build websites and design elements right now, which I have already began to do upon recommendation from my peers.

                            <br>After completing and receiving feedback for the previous assignment I have seen how much I need to grow to be able to fill the position I wish to obtain, and I have not changed my stance on my future career if anything it has made me more motivated to obtain and achieve the relevant skills and leadership experience. 
                            <br><br>
                            I believe with a lot of time and motivation my goal is very achievable it isn’t a short-term goal and my overall drive to a obtain this position hasn’t changed I have just realised the time that it will take to obtain this career will be extensive. 
                            <br><br>
                            My career plan doesn’t fall entirely in with everyone else’s, but it does coincide with everyone as we are all aiming for IT based industry jobs with common and relative experience between the group.

                            <br>After all the information I took onboard throughout assignment 2 and feedback, my stand on my ideal job hasn’t changed. I still feel as though for myself it would be the most ideal option. A role in which I can still work with kids and have that interaction however also enabling them to learn a little easier through IT. In saying this however I also have considered that there could be other, well-fitting jobs that do partially speak out to me at the same time.  
                            <br>
                            Having fully recapped on the opportunities presented to me I feel as though I would still prefer to be in a school, working as an “IT Manager”. I still strongly believe that this would give me a more informed appreciation for the work that goes in on the environment.

                            <br> After completing and receiving feedback for assignment 2, I realised how niche my original chosen ideal job was. Additionally, since writing the report on blockchain technologies and smart contracts I have been captivated by the ground breaking innovations being developed within the field, leading me to a recalibrated vision of pursuing a career in the domain of smart contracts.

                            <br><br>
                            My initial plan of completing a Bachelor of Computer Science still remains. The only difference now is that I’ll be spending free time learning how to build smart contracts instead of focusing on flight software. How I plan to construct a Launchpad of knowledge is by getting involved with communities, hackathons, learning new programming languages, asking mountains of questions and making tonnes of mistakes along the way to learn from.

                            <br>Following the first assignment I have not changed what I aspire to in my future career. In fact, speaking with the team with what I want to do has made me even hungrier for achieving the level of Cyber Security. To my surprise not many of the team members changed their minds regarding their career goals however, for those that did change their prospective job goals it was more than a slight alteration than a huge change of heart. What is interesting if that across the six of us in the group all our career job goals, we are all vastly different from one another. For example, I am wanting to go into the security and networking sector of IT, Benedict with smart contracts as an emerging sector in IT or Marcus as a Front-end developer. Additionally, I am very confident in my ability to achieve this goal and I do this every day with learning more things about online scams, cyber security podcasts and YouTube videos.

                        <p align="left">
                            There will be a heavy focus on seeking applicants who score high on openness and conscientiousness. 
                            For the job positions that involve frequent personal interaction (BDM, Marketing Coordinator), high extraversion and agreeableness will be favored. We feel a personality screening is advantageous in planting roots that’ll grow into an effective team.

                        <h4 align="left">Topic</h4>
                        <p align="left"><strong>An overview of what you propose to do in your project. Concentrate on the big picture and outcomes, rather than intricate details. At least two paragraphs is expected.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        This project aims to create and monetise a web application that acts as an intermediary between both businesses that deal with advertisements, branding, and marketing, and between those that develop and design video games. 
                        <br><br>
                        Upon launch the web application will provide a service that will allow for the insertion of real-world advertising material into video games, in real-time. Advertising materials will be uploaded onto the service, and strategically served into video games for viewing by consumers based on predetermined metrics. The service with be monetised through a commission-based model where video game developers will be paid based on the how frequently advertising material is viewed in-game.

                        <br>
                        <h4 align="left">MOTIVATION</h4>
                        <p align="left"><strong>What are your motivations for your project. Why is this project important or interesting? How does it fit in with current IT trends? What would it show to a future employer if you were able to work on this project? At least one paragraph is expected.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        For this project, our group aimed to conceptualise an idea that aligned with overlapping interests from all group members. We agreed this project would be interesting and valuable as it is an overlap between the fun pastime of video games, the large world of advertising and marketing, and the technical intricacies of programming and information technology. 
                        <br><br>
                        These fields of Entertainment, Marketing, and Information Technology are all areas our group is interested in, and they are also very well-established with plenty of resources available. This gives us room to build and develop an exciting new service that combines elements from each field and allows us to develop further understanding in these areas. 
                        <br><br>
                        This project will aim to allow video game developers to send and receive advertising information and analytics in an efficient way, using a custom API. API’s are becoming ever more prevalent in the current IT landscape as they allow for consistent and predefined methods of sharing data. As video gaming has been slowly shifting towards an ‘always online’ experience, we feel it is time to utilise this connectivity to integrate video gaming into the world of advertising. 
                        <br><br>
                        By developing this project, we hope to showcase our ability to utilise Information Technology in innovative ways to further monetise the video game industry.

                        <h4 align="left">LANDSCAPE</h4>
                        <p align="left"><strong>While overarching idea of our project already exists in the form of In-Game Advertising &#40;IGA&#41; and more specifically Dynamic In-Game Advertising &#40;DIGA&#41;, however we believe the methodology and implementation leaves much to be desired.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                        The only real ‘competitor’ that claims to offer Dynamic In-Game Advertising is a an organisation named RapidFire. RapidFire is a digital marketing company that specialises in in-game advertising, and operates via a consultation based method. 
                        <br><br>
                        RapidFire offer Dynamic In-Game Advertising and they tout this advertising channel as a real-time service that can provide advertising in video games in “the form of placements such as billboards, posters, and hoardings situated throughout a 3D video game environment.”<a href="https://www.rapidfire.com/portfolio/dynamic-in-game-advertising/" target="_blank"><sub>[1]</sub></a>.  
                        <br><br>
                        Our project and delivery would differ slightly, as we would aim to be an easily accessible online platform where brands can quickly set up their own campaigns, upload materials, and have them be streamed directly into games. We would aim to remove as much of the consultation requirements as possible by providing a seamless platform that does most of the heavy lifting.

                            The aim of this project is to create an online platform where advertising and marketing materials can be uploaded and then delivered into video games via an API.<br>
                            This product would be widely accessible and globally available to provide a platform that fills the needs of advertisers and consumers in a non-invasive and non-detrimental to both the advertisers, consumer and audience.

                            <li>Build a website that is intuitive and accessible to a global market.<br>
                            This will begin with designing visual skeleton of the website while imagining ourselves in the shoes of a potential client. Doing so will guide our design decisions in a way that’ll determine the hierarchy of elements on the page, what happens when you hover a cursor over a link, an image, page layout etc. From the CSS and HTML skeleton we’ll assign buttons that’ll trigger functions and interact with the raw mechanics of the website.</li>
                            <li>Create a database to store materials uploaded via website.<br>
                            This project requires a place to hold store all the information that will be input by users or uploaded onto the website. It will need to be accessible through a custom API so that video game developers are able to get and put data from the server. This is essential for the success of this project.</li>
                            <li>Develop a custom API that allows for sending and receiving of information from database.<br>
                            The project requires an API that will allow for information to be accessed and stored in real time. Video game developers will use this API to get advertising material from the platform and information from the game developers will be send back to the server for further analytics.</li>
                            <li>Create documentation for the API to make it easy for game developers to implement into games.<br>
                            With proper documentation and citation for the API it will make it exceedingly easier and more intuitive for game developers to easily and effectively implement Advertdapt’s vision within their game for ease of use and a positive experience.</li>

                        <p align="left">
                            In our first MS Teams meeting dating back to our first team assignment, we went around as a group and exchanged what our ideas were for our assignment 1 project idea. Marcus shared with us his genius, imaginative blueprint of a web service connecting game developers with brands to create a fresh new approach to advertising in games. In our second team assignment we discussed different technologies and techniques that’d help manifest the idea. 
                            <br><br>
                            Imagining the website from the clients perspective is an incredibly efficient way to determine how the website should visually present itself to ensure a flawless intuitive product. Working backwards by designing the website and determining the mechanics afterwards.
                            <br><br>
                            To use the website, a representative from either a game developer or brand needs to register an account. There are two types of accounts, one for the game developer and another for the brand. 
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Game Developer Account</strong>
                            <br>
                            If a game developer wishes to register with the website they will follow the respective prompt after following the “Register” link. There they will pick the “Game Developer” option and will be lead to a a page where they are required to fill out necessary information.</p> 
                            <ul align="left">
                                <li>First Name</li>

                                <li>Password</li> 
                                <li>Confirm Password</li>

                            Once they have filled out the mandatory information, they’ll now have an account on the website where they now have the ability to list a new advertisement vacancy available to rent. 
                            <br><br>
                            There’ll be a “+ New Listing “link in the header to direct the game developer to a form that they’ll fill out to create a new listing. 
                            In the “New Ad Listing” tab, the game developer will be asked to supply the following.

                            <br>
                            What game the advertising space will be featured on. 
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Advertisement Type</strong>
                            <br>
                            Advertisement types can be both ‘2D’ and ‘3D’, in a sense that flat images like ground stickers and billboards will be jpeg, gif and png files while 3D files will be CAD files. Information regarding the necessary dimensions and size of the file will be outlined within the same section of ‘Advertisement Type’ 
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Monthly Players</strong>
                            <br>
                            Game developers need to provide realistic, truthful figures on how many unique monthly players they receive so the potential brand that wishes to advertise on their listing can gauge if the price is reasonable or not.
                            <br><br> 
                            <strong>User Statistics</strong>
                            <br>
                            Similar to the monthly players, user statistics should be required but aren’t mandatory for the initial stages. Users statistics will include geographical location of players, their age, gender etc. This is included so advertisers can accurately direct their product at specific groups of people. 
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Asking Price</strong>
                            <br>
                            Required to determine the price of renting the available promotional space. Game developers also need to specify if the price is on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. 
                            <br><br> 
                            <strong>Description</strong>
                            <br>
                            A description is vital for the game developer to communicate what it is they are offering. Here they’ll explain the rental space and may even mention what the game is about. 
                            <br><br> 
                            <strong>Images</strong>
                            <br> 
                            Lastly, the game developer needs to upload pictures to the potential brand customer knows where and what their advertisement will look like.  
                            After all the information is filled in they will click a button to list the advertising space. 
                            <br><br> 
                            <strong>Brand Account</strong>
                            <br>
                            Brand accounts are responsible for purchasing the rental spaces from the game developers. 
                            <br><br> 
                            If a brand/ company wishes to register with the website they will follow the respective prompt after following the “Register” link. There they will pick the “Brand/ Company” option and will be lead to a a page where they are required to fill out necessary information.</p>
                            <ul align="left">
                                <li>First Name</li>
                                <li>Last Name</li>
                                <li>Email</li>

                            <p align="left"> 
                            Now that the person representing a brand has created a brand account, they now have the ability to purchase advertising space from game developers. Back on the homepage a brand representative will click on an advertisement listing proposed by a game developer. 
                            <br><br>
                            After clicking the listing they’ll be able to view a neat outline of the details regarding the advertising space.</p>
                            <ul align="left">
                                <li>Game title</li>
                                <li>Advertisement Type + Required Specs</li>
                                <li>Monthly Players</li>
                                <li>User Statistics</li>
                                <li>Asking price</li>
                                <li>Description</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p align="left">
                            Additionally, the brand representative will have the option to message the game developer representative to clarify any questions they may have. Once they’re happy they’ll add the space to their shopping cart where they can now go to the checkout to fill in the last details. 
                            <br><br>
                            The checkout will require the brand representative to upload the appropriate file type with the dimensions considered. After uploading said file, they will need to determine the duration they wish to advertise their brand for. A final cost will be calculated based upon the duration multiplied by the rate supplied by the game developer. Once that’s done, they’ll proceed to pay with a preferred payment method (either paypal, bank transfer, cryptocurrency). 
                            <br><br>
                            Once the payment has been made, the file will be ported onto the game's API endpoint, where it will now be displayed and advertised within the game.

                        <h3 align="left">Roles</h3>
                        <p align="left">We didn’t get to the point of committing to designating roles to the website as we felt we had dreamt of something substantially larger than we could create, while a great idea it is and was, the more research we were dusted off, the more we found ourselves uncovering a mammoth skeleton of a project, overwhelmed of where to begin.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3 align="left">Scopes and Limits</h3>
                        <p align="left">For a project like this there is so much room for growth and development that it is easy for the scope to quickly creep out of control. Due to this we outlined three specific deliverables that best encapsulate the overarching idea of the project.</p>
                        <ul align="left">
                        <li>Website</li>
                        <li>Database</li>
                        <li>API</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p align="left">
                        <strong>Website</strong>
                        <br>
                        The website would be the first and most important deliverable, as it will serve as the main point of access for any brands or advertisers seeking to use the service. We will require a website that allows for the following functionality.</p>
                        <ul align="left">
                            <li>Account creation and secure login for brands and game developers.</li>
                            <li>Portal behind a secure login where customer specific information can be shown.</li>
                            <li>The ability to upload multimedia files &#40;images and videos&#41;.</li>
                            <li>The ability to define the rules for how an advertisement is shown and to which demographic. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <p align="left">
                        <strong>Database</strong>
                        <br>
                        We require a database that can receive images and details uploaded to the website. This is the second most important deliverable as we require somewhere to store all customer information and advertising data. The database will require the following functionality.</p>
                        <ul align="left">
                            <li>Receive and store information uploaded to the website.</li>
                            <li>Serve information upon request to the website.</li>
                            <li>Serve information upon request to a video game via API call.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        <p align="left">
                        <strong>API</strong>
                        <br>
                        Perhaps the most difficult part of the project will be the development of a custom API that will be used to pull advertising materials from the database and serve them into games. We will require the following functionality. </p>
                        <ul align="left">
                            <li>Get requests to retrieve data from the server.</li>
                            <li>Put requests to send data back to the server.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p align="left">Once these 3 parts of the project are met, we will have developed a functional prototype that we can further expand upon. This will allow us to demonstrate a working product and let us provide potential employees or even investors with a proof of concept. </p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3 align="left">Tools and Technologies</h3>
                        <h4 align="left">Software Required</h4>
                        <p align="left"><strong>Knack –</strong> Knack was founded in 2010 and is supposedly one of the better online database tools. We would need something like this or similar as we would have to have a consistent storage for certain advertisers to hold their preferred ad or ads. 
                        <br>
                        Link - <a href="https://www.knack.com/" target="_blank">https://www.knack.com/</a>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Sublime Text –</strong> Sublime Text would be used to create the pathways in which we would use to allow advertisers to gain access to input their specific ads. Alongside this we would also use it to allow game developers to have easy access to all the advertisements to choose from. This is Kieren’s preferred coding program. 
                        <br>
                        Link - <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">https://www.sublimetext.com/</a>
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>GitHub –</strong> We would use GitHub as an access point to allow companies to register and upload their advertisements so that they could be entered into a database. This would allow developers to access a large quantity of advertisers and find one to suit the desired space. 
                        <br>

                        <br><br>
                        <h3 align="left">Testing</h3>
                        <p align="left">Due to the nature of our product, it would be in our best interest to implement our product inside a very simply made game. This game could be made in house or it could be outsourced to another Australian developer. This test video game would need to be complex but can implement our product to present to video game developers and potential brand clients. After this mock-up has been made, we could then use it as supporting material to present to indie game developers and brand clients to demonstrate what our product is capable of and how it benefits their business to increase brand awareness, thus, increase sales. As we would in our start-up phase of the business, we would mainly target indie developers and smaller brands with a modest commission based on total number of players, downloads and sales targets met.
                        <br><br>
                        After contracts are signed up and our product has been implemented in the video games our success can be measured in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul align="left">
                        <li><strong>Testimonials:</strong> These can be used as evidence for landing larger brant clients and bigger development studios. Having positive testimonials in our contract negotiations and on our webpage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sales Numbers:</strong> Requesting sales numbers from the advertising brands can be examined by our marketing team to gauge the interactions and response from seeing these advertisements in the video game. Obtaining sales from the developer/publisher can also be great way to measure success as our revolutionary product can create hype around the games and could push curious gamers to purchase the game to see this for themselves.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brand Awareness:</strong> One way that Adverdapt’s success can be measured is acknowledgement of the product across IT, video games, and marketing industries. The IT could see this a brand-new product that other could aspire to learn and try to implement the concept in their sector. The video games industries might shift towards having real-time factual advertisements in video games with which they could partner with a brand and assist with funding development of their new game. Lastly, the marketing industry could see this as another avenue for advertising and getting their products seen by their target audiences.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increased Number of Adverdapt Enquiries:</strong> This can go together with the above-mentioned points, as the brand awareness and attention fall on the Adverdapt product we could see increases in brands and video games developers wanting to collaborate with one another.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><br>

                        <h3 align="left">Risks</h3>
                        <p align="left">The key risk we have identified within this project is that Dynamic In-Game Advertising has not been perfected or done the way that we have envisioned it. This means that while we very well may pioneer and revolutionise this type of advertising, we are also running blind and do not have any other companies to compare ourselves to. It is hard to know what works and doesn’t work unless we do it ourselves, therefore there is a high risk of failure if we put all our eggs in one basket and it doesn’t turn out the way we planned. To counter this, we will need to try and minimise the risks and take small steps while tracking the results to see if we’re going in the right direction.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <h3 align="left">Group Processes and Communications</h3>
                        <p align="left">We want to ensure smooth communications between group members to facilitate timely completion of this project. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our first step towards in our process of communication will be to share phone numbers to be used as emergency contact. We do not want to use our phones as the key point of contact as we believe it is not as effective or easy to record key details as other software solutions. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our second step will be to outline our weekly availability and members prior commitments outside of the project. This will allow us to schedule weekly video meetings through MS Teams where we will be able to recap and summarise the previous weeks work and outline goals for the next week. These meetings will be recorded both digitally and through the taking of meeting minutes. 
                        Meeting minutes will be used to highlight topics that require additional work, and will be shared with all members as a record of what is required for the next week. Additional ad-hoc meetings can be organised and recorded with fewer group members present if required. 
                        <br><br>
                        The third step in our process will be to use Discord as an informal way of quickly contacting other members of the group, this will allow for the quick flow of information and all members of the group will be able to check messages and updates in an asynchronous manner. If any detailed are highlighted as important for the whole group and require further discussion, they will be added the next MS Teams meeting agenda for further follow up and in-depth group discussion. 
                        <br><br>
                        If group members are not contactable or miss any meetings we will proceed without them and continue to try to get in contact via phone as outlined in our first step. If we manage to get in contact we will fill them in on any information they might have missed. </p>

                        <p align="left">The Git repository was only really used at the very end of the assignment as the group had full confidence in Kieren that he was working hard on the website and that it would look the best that he could with his tenured skills.
                        <br><br>
                        Closer to the submission of the assinment Kieren's first upload to the GitHub repository was all html files, image files and other website elements to make sure they had no issues uploading and we could test the websites functions when clicking on the Git pages link.</p>

                        <ul align="left">
                            <li>GitHub/GitPages – GitHub/Pages was used mainly to host our website and do basic commits, mainly in Kieren’s name due to the fact Kieren was a huge asset in the design and development of the website and we all trusted him to make great contributions.</li>
                            <li>MS Teams – We used MS Teams as our recorded meeting platform, anything on a more serious note regarding the assignment was stated in meetings here.</li>
                            <li>Discord – Discord was our preferred method of communication due to it being extremely accessible, versatile and being easy to navigate on both phone and PC. Alongside this it can also be used as a virtual bulletin board. With all group members having previously used discord to some extent, it is familiar to all of us.</li>
                            <li>Trello – We begun implementing Trello too late in the project whilst Trello is extremely beneficial to project development and structure we were unable to utilise it to its full potential as we made a structure but by the time the due date came around it was a rush to complete the assignment.</li>

                        <p align="left"><strong>What went well?</strong> As a group we all work extremely well together it feels like everyone contributes evenly. There is never any animosity between members and everyone’s input is valued equally.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What could be improved?</strong> The key problem we faced as a group was getting all the members together to discuss and plan how we were going to approach each section. Without the whole group present it felt like we could be overriding someone else’s opinion and I think we could have benefited by having a nominated group leader to make executive decisions to help with getting things moving.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> I was surprised at how well we all come together as a team to finish things off even when we leave things a bit later than we should have, everyone pulls their weight and makes up for time lost.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong> It is extremely difficult to work within everyone’s individual schedules and existing life commitments, I found that groups can function a lot better when assisted by technology.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</strong> The way that we allocated roles will not reflect equal contribution within the GitHub logs, as we designated one team member to be our GitHub expert in charge of all updates.

                        <p align="left"><strong>What went well?</strong> I believe that we all work very well together when we are all present and available everyone contributes well when we are all there. There is never a hostility or aggression towards each other and we all get along very well.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What could be improved?</strong> I believe the main issue that we face as a group is that it is difficult for us all to be available for meetings and group collaborations as there is a small-time difference and people working full-time and such at most we can maybe get 5/6 people into a call at a time.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> Our great ability to come together as a team to smash out the assignment within the time as a full team working together under stress.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong> It is difficult to work with everyone’s individual schedules and personal commitments, but we work well even with those issues based on message boards and fast turn arounds to responses.

                        <p align="left"><strong>What went well?</strong> I feel as though when most of the members were available, we used the time rather effectively, mostly making the time for at least two members to be in a call to help if needed. Using some of the groups previous experience within certain parts of the assignment also assisted rather heavily
                        <br>
                        <strong>What could be improved?</strong> Time management was a huge downfall for our group yet again as it forced us to push harder to the deadline. Group participation was also something that let us down, trying to get all members into a meeting was exceptionally hard as we all have prior engagements with work and other personal matters.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> I was extremely surprised to see that this idea has not been overly engaged in as it is such an open market for software, there is lots of money to be made with this idea and it's just shocking that it has barely been touched.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong> Once everyone is on the same page, working as a group is extremely easy as it lightens the workload of some people however when it's not evenly distributed It can cause others to over stress and have their work levels drop.

                        <p align="left"><strong>What went well?</strong> Again, discord was proven to be a winner in acting as our main instant communication channel. The strongest perk of discord was being able to quickly bounce ideas, schedule meetings and share useful links. The team were a great likeminded bunch to hang out with online.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What could be improved?</strong> Reiterating comments from assignment 2, we failed to enforce a disciplined approach to setting strict deadlines for individual tasks early on. When enrolling in subjects, I imagine we are consciously deciding to invest in our future careers by taking on a HECS/HELP loan. I thought the monetary stake would have acted as kindling for motivating conscientious work habits towards the final projects.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> I was and still am surprised at the lack of competitors within dynamic in game advertising.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong> Coordinating meetings where an entire group share overlapping availability was akin to waiting for 6 planets to align on an axis. Most had busy lives outside of study which was understandable. Its incredible what teams are capable of building when they’re separated by thousands of kilometres, the future of remote work in IT related fields looks optimistic.

                        <strong>Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</strong> The GitHub activity log does not accurately represent the contributions of individuals. We elected one member to design and upload the content to the website. Kudos to Kieren.

                        <p align="left"><strong>What went well?</strong> Every time a meeting was organised at least majority of the group attended. There would be some meetings where some of could make it and some of us couldn’t. At least the groups members made a proper effort to attend. The communication is great too! As we found discord the easiest platform to stay connected, there is a group general billboard used by everyone to say what they have done so far and what needs to completed next, or even the general progression of the assignment.
                        <br>
                        <strong>What could be improved?</strong> Having a team leader may have made things easier for the group and for completing the assignment material. To help with this I tried to message in the chat to see how things had gone during the day as I am working full-time.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that was surprising?</strong> One thing that did surprise me and the rest of the group was how quickly the submission date had approached. Additionally, the whole group jumped in and most of us got involved.
                        <br>
                        <strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</strong> It’s difficult to organise a group when a lot of the team members have full-time work or personal commitments that conflict with other members’ availability. Trying to get the whole team in for a MS teams call may have been the hardest thing about the group assignments.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your GitHub log of activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment.</strong> Github can be useful for logging the groups work on the website, however, as I had stood up to do the website, I learnt to do website product differently by working on the html files locally then uploading to the repository at the end. I was fortunate that the team trusted me and my ability to create the website and complete it in time.
